docker makes it really easy to install and run software without worrying about setup or dependencies
an image is a standalone , isolated , lightweight and executable package that contains all requierd components (code , runtime , system tools , libraries , settings ) necessary to run an application 
the container is the runtime instance of the image. from the same image your can launch more containers
